Scripts and Bots

* PythonBotTest.py | This is basically a simple skeleton for now, for people to test.  I'll add more to it once I get people on board.  Python required to be installed on your system - tested with Python 3.2.3 on Windows only.  Only one server works at a time per instance, so, you will need to run as many instances for how many servers you want to run the bot on, and although the bot can be joined to multiple channels, the way its commands work, will not allow them to work inside other channels than the main (unless things are written differently), and any commands issued in and directly from another chanel will actually show the output return in the main channel.  So, just run multiple instances and edit the script of each instance to use the bot in multiple channels and on multiple servers/networks.
